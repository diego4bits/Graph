## `connect(other: Node, edge: Relation) -> None`

#### Description:
This method performs the action of connecting two nodes with an edge. It is used to establish a relationship between two nodes. This method belongs to the class Node.

#### Parameters:
- `other` (`Node`): The node that will be connected to the current node.
- `edge` (`Relation`): The type of relationship that will be established between the two nodes.

#### Returns:
- `None`: This method does not return anything.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
node1 = Node()
node2 = Node()
relation = Relation()
node1.connect(node2, relation)

# Another use case (if applicable)
node3 = Node()
relation = Relation()
node2.connect(node3, relation)
```

#### How it Works:

The `connect` method first uses the `connect_right` method of the current node (`self`) to connect it to the `other` node with the specified `edge`. Then, it uses the `connect_right` method of the `other` node to connect it back to the current node with the same `edge`.

#### Dependencies:
- `Relation`: This class represents the type of relationship that will be established between the two nodes.
