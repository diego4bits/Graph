## `connections() -> List[Node]`

#### Description:
This method returns a list of connected nodes. It is used to retrieve the nodes that are connected to the current node. This method belongs to the class Node.

#### Parameters:
This method does not take any parameters.

#### Returns:
- `List[Node]`: A list of Node objects representing the nodes that are connected to the current node.

#### Exceptions:
This method does not throw any exceptions.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
result_case1 = connections()
print(result_case1)

# Another use case (if applicable)
result_case2 = connections()
print(result_case2)
```

#### How it Works:
The method calls the `_relation.connected_nodes()` method to retrieve the list of connected nodes. It then returns this list as the result.

#### Dependencies:
- `Relation`: This method depends on the `Relation` class, which is imported from the `Relation` module. The `Relation` class is responsible for managing the relationships between nodes.
