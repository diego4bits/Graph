## `RedBlackTree`

#### Description:
This class represents a Red-Black Tree data structure.

#### Attributes:
- None

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case of instantiating and using the class
tree = RedBlackTree()
# The rest of the example
```

#### How it Works:
The `RedBlackTree` class is used to create and manipulate a Red-Black Tree. A Red-Black Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where each node has an extra attribute called color, which can be either red or black. The tree maintains five properties to ensure that it remains balanced:
1. Every node is either red or black.
2. The root is black.
3. Every leaf (NULL) is black.
4. If a node is red, then both its children are black.
5. For each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the same number of black nodes.

#### Dependencies:
This class does not have any dependencies.
