## `_fix_insert(k: Node) -> None`

#### Description:
This method fixes the red-black tree after an insertion operation. It is used to maintain the balance and properties of the red-black tree. This method belongs to the class RedBlackTree.

#### Parameters:
- `k` (`Node`): The node that was inserted and needs to be fixed.

#### Returns:
- `None`: This method does not return anything.

#### Exceptions:
This method does not throw any exceptions.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
tree = RedBlackTree()
node = Node(10)
tree._fix_insert(node)
```

#### How it Works:
The `_fix_insert` method uses a while loop to fix the red-black tree. It checks the color of the parent node of the inserted node and performs different operations based on the color and position of the parent node.

If the parent node is red, the method checks if the uncle node (sibling of the parent's parent) is also red. If the uncle node is red, the colors of the parent, uncle, and grandparent nodes are updated, and the current node is set to the grandparent node. This process continues until the root node is reached.

If the uncle node is not red, the method performs rotations and color updates to maintain the balance and properties of the red-black tree.

The method terminates when the root node is reached and its color is set to black.

#### Dependencies:
This method does not have any dependencies.
