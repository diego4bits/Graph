## `Edge`

#### Description:
This class represents an edge, which is a connection between two nodes in a graph.

#### Attributes:
- `_printable_attr` (`Set`): A set of attributes that can be printed. Default: `set()`.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case of instantiating and using the class
edge = Edge()
# The rest of the example
```

#### How it Works:

The `Edge` class represents an edge between two nodes in a graph. It has a set of attributes that can be printed. When an instance of the class is created, the `_printable_attr` attribute is initialized as an empty set.
