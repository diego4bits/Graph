This code snippet is the main function that demonstrates the functionality of the User class and its associated classes (Friend and Enemy). It creates instances of User, connects them using Friend and Enemy objects, and performs various operations to test the connections between users.

#### Important info:
This code snippet is used to test the functionality of the User class and its connections.

#### Usage :

- This code snippet is used to test the connection functionality of the User class.
- This code snippet is used to verify the correctness of the connection operations.
- This code snippet is used to demonstrate the usage of the Friend and Enemy classes.

#### How it Works:
The code snippet creates instances of User, Friend, and Enemy classes. It then connects the users using the connect and connect_right methods of the User class. The code snippet then performs various operations to test the connectivity between users and prints the results.

#### Dependencies:
- `Node`: The User class depends on the Node class to represent the users and their connections.
- `Edge`: The User class depends on the Edge class to represent the connections between users.

Note: The code snippet assumes that the Node and Edge classes are imported from the respective files, but the import statements are not included in the provided code snippet.
